            <p>Brian is a young man passionate about using technology to create impactful user experiences. He's a skilled Front-End Engineer proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React frameworks. With a keen eye for design, he excels in Adobe XD and Figma, ensuring a seamless blend of aesthetics and functionality.

                Brian's passion for technology began when he was a young boy. He initially wanted to pursue Software Engineering but didn't get the chance. Even though his dreams seemed shattered momentarily, his determination remained strong. In May 2023, he enrolled at CodeCademy to pursue Software Engineering, but he felt there was something missing, a crucial element he called "The Secret Sauce."
                
                Fortunately, in February, 2024 he received a scholarship with the MasterCard Foundation, to pursue Software Engineering at ALX Africa. The program encompassed both soft skills (leading self, tech skills, leading others, impactful communication, teamwork, problem-solving, research, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, managing complex tasks & entrepreneurial thinking) and hard skills (JavaScript,HTML5, CSS, Git & Github, ReactJS Framework, APIs, Postman, and design tools like Figma & Adobe XD). This comprehensive training has made him a valuable asset for collaboration on exciting opportunities in the tech industry.
